# Do not submit pull requests to this repo!
Pull requests are public which means other candidates can see your changes and potentially copy them as their own and submit them with their application.  You should submit your work as a zip file through your supplier/recruiter.  They will send it through the proper channels to get to RFA for review.

Please do not contact the users of this organization directly.  South Carolina government requires certain procedures occur when hiring contractors.  The only response you will receive from any user in this organization will be to contact your supplier/recruiter.

Thank you for your understanding.
