# RFA Code Exercise
This exercise involves improving a fictional subset of a Ruby on Rails 5.x application.  It only contains a model, controller, and two views.

You should assume the technology stack used for this code includes:
* Ruby on Rails 5.x
* Ruby 2.3.x (MRI)
* PostgreSQL Database
* ERB
* jQuery
* Moment.js

## Instructions

Refactor and improve the code.  Add directories/files as needed.

You are not expected to run the code or make this work as a real Rails application.
